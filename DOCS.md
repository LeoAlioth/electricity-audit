# Home Assistant Add-on: Electricity Audit

Processes data from a single/multiple electricity meters and detects different consumers

## How to use

This add-on really does nothing currently. It is just an empty thing based on ha example.

When started it will print the configured message or "Hello world" in the log.

It will also print "All done!" in `/share/example_addon_output.txt` to show
simple example of the usage of `map` in addon config.
